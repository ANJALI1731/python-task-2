TASK 2 

In this project, I created an automated weather report generator using Python. I used a CSV file with weather data and processed it using pandas. Then, I visualized the weather conditions using a pie chart with matplotlib, and finally, I generated a complete PDF report using FPDF. The report includes a neat table of each state's temperature, humidity, and weather condition, plus a summary of how many states have each weather type. I also added the pie chart into the PDF to make it more visual. The final output is a PDF file and a pie chart image, both saved automatically. To run the project, you just need to install the required libraries and run the Python script with the CSV file in the same folder.
